# Kerberos_Auth_in_Data_Pipeline

Integrating Python-based Kerberos authentication with retry functionality into your existing setup, which currently handles authentication via a shell script, can be achieved with minimal changes to your current architecture. Here's a structured way to go about it:

# Step 1: Understanding Your Current Setup
Your current system likely involves:

A shell script that initializes Kerberos authentication using kinit and possibly sets some environment variables.
The same shell script then calls a Python script to perform further operations.
# Step 2: Prepare the Python Kerberos Authentication Function
Ensure your Python function for Kerberos authentication with retry is robust. Here's a simple template of what this function might look like using the kerberos module:

```
import kerberos
import time

def kerberos_auth_with_retry(principal, keytab, retries=3, delay=5):
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            kerberos.authGSSClientInit("krb5_ccache_name")
            # Assuming your environment is set up to find the Kerberos ticket
            kerberos.kinit(principal, keytab)
            print("Kerberos authentication successful.")
            return True
        except kerberos.KrbError as e:
            print(f"Authentication attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
            time.sleep(delay)
    print("Kerberos authentication failed after retries.")
    return False
```
# Step 3: Modify Your Existing Shell Script
You don’t need to completely overhaul your existing setup. Instead, integrate the call to the Python Kerberos authentication function within the existing shell script. Here’s how you could adjust the shell script:

Source the Variables File: Continue to source your variables file as you currently do to set up any environment variables necessary for your application.
Invoke Python for Kerberos Authentication: Before running the main Python script, add a new Python invocation that specifically handles Kerberos authentication.Modify your shell script like this:
```
# Source environment variables
source /path/to/your/variables_file.sh

# New Python call for Kerberos authentication
python -c 'import your_authentication_module; your_authentication_module.kerberos_auth_with_retry("your_principal", "your_keytab")'

# Existing Python script call
python /path/to/your/existing_script.py
```
Handle Authentication Failure: Optionally, you can modify the script to handle the case where authentication fails, preventing the main Python script from running.
# Step 4: Test the Modified Setup
Thoroughly test the updated workflow to ensure:

The Kerberos authentication step completes successfully and retries as expected upon failure.
The main Python script runs only after successful authentication.
The environment variables and any other setup required by the main Python script remain functional after these changes.
Conclusion
This integration allows you to keep the structural integrity of your existing system largely intact while enhancing the authentication process with more robust error handling and retries. It also keeps changes localized, minimizing the impact on the existing codebase.
